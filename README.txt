                                        LIMBA
README:
    Limba is a Banking management system I have created to help beginner/intermediate python
    programmers see how a banking system can be implemented. This project was full completed in python.
     However, it can be done in other programming languages also.

    Limba as a system that connects client information to an Exel work sheet (Banking User Info.xlsx)
    acting as the database. This spreed sheet is of 1000 rows and the data contained have been
    randomly generated by a few function calls using Beautiful Soup (bs4) a python library for pulling
     HTML and XML data. In short... None of the accounts are real.

    The Bank.py file contain main function calls for regular banking operations (deposit, withdraw),
    every change done to this file might affect the functionality of the project and connection
    to the Excel file.

    The BankingDMS.py file contain the user experience functions. These provide the user with options,
    and help the database run smoothly. Finally, the BugSolutions.py file contains any third party
    syntax and solutions to behind the sines problems.

NOTICE:
    Make use you connect the Banking User Info.xlsx file to the Bank.py file before everything else.
    The PairAcc.py file has not been completed, so it will not do you any good at this time.
